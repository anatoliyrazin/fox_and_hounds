### Fox and Hounds

#### Build strategy for the game and HTML5 canvas demo

Dynamic programming solution to build the full result table for all game combinations - C/C++ module

HTML5 canvas based demo: using only binary W/L data (without "fastest" way to win) and therefore makes some foolish extra moves, however always wins. I am planning to change it: it will be still using binary data, but will have some smarter way to move hounds.
